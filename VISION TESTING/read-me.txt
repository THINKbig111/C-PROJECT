Vision Testing System

 Project Overview

The Vision Testing System was developed in 2023 during my first year at Daeyang University. This project aimed to create a console-based application that assists in preliminary eye examinations. The system supports various functionalities including patient registration, visual acuity testing, color blindness assessment, and data management.
 Objectives

- To simulate a basic eye examination environment using C programming.
- To manage patient records efficiently.
- To provide basic recommendations for eye care based on test results.

 Features

1. User Interface:
   - A console-based interface with interactive prompts and visual elements.
   - ASCII art and text formatting to enhance user engagement.

2. Patient Management:
   - Adding, searching, updating, and deleting patient records.
   - Storing patient details such as name, age, gender, and test results.

3. Vision Tests:
   - Visual Acuity Test: Simulates reading a Snellen chart and calculates a percentage score based on correct answers.
   - Color Blindness Test: Uses color boxes to test the patient's ability to distinguish between different colors.
   - Astigmatism Test:  Basic shape orientation test to check for astigmatism symptoms.

4. Data Analysis:
   - Analysis of test results to recommend whether the patient needs glasses, and what type if any.
   - Suggestions for further medical consultation if necessary.

 Learning Outcomes

- Enhanced understanding of C programming, particularly in handling file I/O operations and console manipulation.
- Gained insights into basic medical diagnostics related to vision testing.
- Developed skills in structuring larger C projects and modularizing code for readability and maintainability.

 Future Improvements

- Integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Implementing real-time data processing and analysis.
- Adding more comprehensive vision tests and medical advice modules.

 Conclusion

The Vision Testing System project was a significant learning experience, combining software development skills with basic medical knowledge. It showcased the power of programming in solving real-world problems, particularly in the field of healthcare technology.
